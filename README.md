# When to surf
Shows you best surf time based on your location. Demo: https://whentosurf.co

I launched it on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/when-to-surf) 

And also wrote a story how I done this app on [Medium](https://medium.com/@AndreyAzimov/i-learned-to-code-and-build-a-web-app-in-2-months-da8f2932c139#.j44kivg7u)



You need just PHP server to run all this.

P.S. Code is super hardcore. Enjoy.
